### MadLand 2023 annual meeting talk

Talk title: Galaxy: Illuminating Plant Biology throught Isoform Analysis and Beyond

#### Abstract

Isoform analysis holds immense importance in plant biology, as alternative splicing generates multiple isoforms from a single gene, significantly expanding the functional diversity of the plant proteome. Accurate identification and quantification of isoforms are fundamental for unravelling the complex regulatory networks governing plant development, stress responses, and specialised metabolism.
Galaxy offers a wide array of specialised tools and workflows tailored specifically for isoform analysis. These tools enable plant biologists to perform critical tasks such as transcript assembly, isoform quantification, and identification of differentially expressed isoforms. By leveraging Galaxy's capabilities, researchers can gain insights into the dynamic and intricate nature of plant gene expression, facilitating advancements in plant sciences.

Furthermore, the Galaxy platform promotes collaboration and knowledge sharing among scientists. Its accessibility, reproducibility, and data-sharing capabilities create a collaborative environment, encouraging researchers to exchange protocols, reproduce results, and foster an open science culture within the plant biology community.
This scientific talk aims to emphasise the significance of the Galaxy platform in facilitating bioinformatics analysis for plant biologists. Through real-world case studies and practical workflows, the talk will showcase the platform's versatility and its potential to empower plant biologists in unravelling the complexities of plant gene expression. By embracing Galaxy, plant biologists can further advance our understanding of plant biology, opening doors to advancements in agriculture, medicine, and beyond.
